## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Robotics & Autonomous Systems enthusiast with a Master's degree ðŸŽ“. I've had a blast working on research projects, including building an autonomous UAV for 3D reconstruction ðŸ›¸â€”mixing LiDAR, visual, and inertial SLAM with ROS2 + PX4. I'm super passionate about pushing the boundaries of autonomous navigation and robotic perception! ðŸ¤– Feel free to explore my work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you want to chat about robotics!
